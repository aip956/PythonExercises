Evaluate the model prediction model for a data set using the Mean Squared Error method.

In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) or mean squared deviation (MSD) of an estimator 
(of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares 
of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the 
actual value. MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. 
The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive (and not zero) is because of randomness or 
because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate.

The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimator—it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better.

Create a function my_model_evaluation_journey_mean_squared_error which will calculate the 
Mean Squared Error for a predicted model.

You will receive two arguments: true data and predicted data. Both of them are strings, 
you should maybe convert them and eliminate unecessary features ;-)

Converting them into a Panda dataframe might be a good thing. :-)

You should take into consideration, in order to perform a Mean Absolute Error the two matrices must have the same shape. (Panda shape? :-))
