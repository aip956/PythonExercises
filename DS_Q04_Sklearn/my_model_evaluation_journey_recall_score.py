"""
Evaluate the model prediction model for a data set using recall score method.

The recall is the ratio tp / (tp + fn) where tp is the number of true positives and fn the number of false negatives. The recall is intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples. The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0.

Create a function my_model_evaluation_journey_recall_score which will calculate the Recall Score for a predicted model.

You will receive two arguments: true data and predicted data. Both of them are integers.

Average = None
