ANTHEA
* 1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)
** Project Context: Briefly introduce the app and its purpose.
*** Example: "This project is a command-line interface application that leverages a local LLM to provide command suggestions in response to user queries. It simplifies working in the terminal by acting as a smart assistant."
** Problem Statement: What challenge does this app address?
*** Example: "Many users, even experienced developers, forget specific terminal commands or need help constructing complex ones. This app solves that by providing relevant, context-aware command options."

ANTHEA
* 2. Features and Functionality (2-3 minutes)
** Core Features: Highlight the key capabilities of the app.
*** Example: "You can type a queStion, receive 2-5 command suggestions, and select one to execute directly from the CLI."
** User Workflow: Explain how a user interacts with the app.
*** Example: "A user types their question, such as 'How do I find large files in a directory?' The app returns suggestions with descriptions, and the user selects one to execute."
** Local LLM Integration: Mention why you chose Ollama and the benefits of using a local model.
*** Example: "The local LLM ensures privacy and performance by processing everything on the user's machine."

TONY
* 3. Technical Architecture (2-3 minutes)
** System Overview:
Describe the flow of the application.
*** Example: "The app consists of three components: input handling, query processing via Ollama, and output parsing/display."
** Data Handling:
Discuss the use of JSON responses from the LLM and how they streamline the app's workflow.
*** Example: "The LLM returns JSON-formatted command suggestions, making it easier to parse and display structured data to the user."
** Execution Logic:
*** Example: "The app securely runs selected commands using eval, with safeguards to minimize risks."

TONY
* 4. Challenges and Solutions (1-2 minutes)
** Challenges:
*** Example: "One challenge was parsing and displaying suggestions from the LLM in a user-friendly way."
** Solutions:
*** Example: "We addressed this by standardizing JSON responses and using jq for robust parsing."
** Discuss any design tradeoffs, like using eval with caution or balancing simplicity and flexibility.
- Also, getting the program to run locally as well as remote.

ANTHEA
* 5. Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
** Show a live or recorded demo of the app in action.
** Walk through a real-world example, such as asking the app a question, reviewing the suggestions, and executing a command.
** Highlight the smooth user experience and accurate command generation.

TONY
* 6. Future Improvements (1 minute)
- Make it so it can be used in a pipeline, pipe data into and out of CLIQ.
** Discuss how you’d expand or improve the app.
*** Example: "In the future, we could add natural language feedback if a user isn’t satisfied with the options or integrate more security features."
** Mention possible integrations with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud-based LLMs.
- We could add more models

TONY
* 7. Conclusion (1 minute)
** Summarize the project:
"This CLI app enhances productivity by simplifying command-line usage with AI-powered suggestions."
** Highlight the key takeaway:
"It bridges the gap between user questions and command-line execution, offering a seamless experience."
** End with gratitude and invite questions.
