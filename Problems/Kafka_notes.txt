Fundamentals
Key elements of Kafka
    Producer sends data to Kafka
        Optional; Kafka sends ack or nack back (acknowledged, not ack)
        Many producers send data to Kafka concurrently
    Brokers: Kafka consists of a bunch of Brokers / cluster of Brokers
        Broker receives data from Producers and store temporarily in page cache or permanently on disk after the OS flushes page cache
        Brokers keep the data ready for downstream consumers
        Data is kept per retention time (1 week default)
Each element's responsibilities
Topic, Partitions, Segments
