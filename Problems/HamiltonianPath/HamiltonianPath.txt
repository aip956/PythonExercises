Hamiltonian Path Coding Challenge
Goal
By the end of this challenge, you should be able to:
Define a Hamiltonian Path.
Identify situations where this algorithm is the best solution.
Implement multiple approaches.
Analyze time complexity.
Adapt your approach based on input size.

Step 1: Understand the Problem
Question 1: Explain in your own words
What is a Hamiltonian Path?
How does it differ from an Eulerian path?
When would a Hamiltonian path be useful in a competition?
Write your answers before moving on.

Step 2: Write a Brute-Force Solution
Before optimizing, implement the most basic solution.
Task 1: Generate all possible paths
Write a function that generates all possible orders of visiting nodes.
Write another function that checks if a given order is a Hamiltonian path.
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use itertools.permutations.
# TODO: Write a function to generate all possible orders of nodes
def generate_permutations(n):
    pass  # Use itertools.permutations

# TODO: Write a function that checks if a given order is a valid Hamiltonian Path
def is_valid_path(graph, path):
    pass  # Loop through the path and check if edges exist

# TODO: Implement the brute-force Hamiltonian Path function
def hamiltonian_path_brute_force(graph):
    pass  # Use generate_permutations and is_valid_path

# Test Case
islands = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
]

print(hamiltonian_path_brute_force(islands))  # Expected: A valid Hamiltonian path or []

Question 2: Time Complexity
What is the time complexity of this solution?
What is the maximum N this could handle in a competition setting?

Step 3: Implement Backtracking
Brute-force is slow. Letâ€™s improve it.
Task 2: Implement a Recursive Backtracking Solution
Start from any node.
Recursively build the path by adding unvisited neighbors.
If you reach a valid Hamiltonian path, return it.
If you hit a dead end, backtrack.
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use a visited array to track which nodes have been used.
# TODO: Write a recursive function to find a Hamiltonian Path using backtracking
def hamiltonian_path_backtracking(graph):
    pass  # Implement backtracking logic

# Test Case
print(hamiltonian_path_backtracking(islands))  # Expected: A valid Hamiltonian path or []

Question 3: Compare to Brute Force
How does this approach improve performance?
What is its worst-case time complexity?

Step 4: Implement an Optimized Solution for Large Graphs
Backtracking is better but still slow for large inputs. For N â‰¥ 20, bitmasking + DP is a better approach.
Task 3: Write a DP-based Hamiltonian Path Algorithm
Use bitmasking to track visited nodes.
Store computed results to avoid recalculations.
ðŸ’¡ Hint: The state is (visited_mask, last_node), where:
visited_mask is a bitmask representing visited nodes.
last_node is the current node.
# TODO: Implement a DP solution with bitmasking for large graphs
def hamiltonian_path_dp(graph):
    pass  # Use a table to store previously computed states

# Test Case
print(hamiltonian_path_dp(islands))  # Expected: A valid Hamiltonian path or []

Question 4: When Should You Use DP?
How does this improve performance?
What is its time complexity?
Would you use this approach for N = 50?

Step 5: Adapt to Competitive Programming
In a coding competition, choosing the best approach is key.
Task 4: Write an Adaptive Function
If N < 8, use brute-force.
If 8 â‰¤ N < 20, use backtracking.
If N â‰¥ 20, use DP.
# TODO: Write a function that selects the best approach based on N
def adaptive_hamiltonian_path(graph):
    pass  # Decide which algorithm to use

# Test Case
print(adaptive_hamiltonian_path(islands))  # Expected: A valid Hamiltonian path or []

Question 5: Strategy Selection
Why not always use the most optimized solution?
In a competition, how would you determine which approach to use quickly?

Step 6: Final Challenge
Write a function that:
Automatically selects the best algorithm.
Handles disconnected graphs.
Runs efficiently on different graph sizes.
Test it on at least three different graphs.

Summary
 Defined a Hamiltonian Path.
 Implemented brute-force, backtracking, and DP approaches.
 Learned when to use each method in a competition.




Solution:

def is_valid(v, pos, path, islands):
    """Check if vertex v can be added to the current path."""
    # Check if there's an edge from the previous vertex in the path to v.
    if islands[path[pos - 1]][v] == 0:
        return False
    # Ensure vertex v hasn't been visited already.
    if v in path:
        return False
    return True

def hamiltonian_path_util(islands, path, pos):
    """Recursive utility function to build the Hamiltonian path."""
    # If all vertices are included in the path, return True.
    if pos == len(islands):
        return True
    # Try to add each vertex to the path.
    for v in range(1, len(islands)):
        if is_valid(v, pos, path, islands):
            path[pos] = v  # Add vertex v to the path.
            # Recur to find the rest of the path.
            if hamiltonian_path_util(islands, path, pos + 1):
                return True
            # Backtrack if the current choice didn't work.
            path[pos] = -1
    return False

def hamiltonian_path(islands):
    """Find a Hamiltonian path starting from the first vertex."""
    path = [-1] * len(islands)  # Initialize the path with -1.
    path[0] = 0  # Start from the first vertex (island 0).
    
    # Start the recursive search.
    if not hamiltonian_path_util(islands, path, 1):
        return []  # No valid Hamiltonian path found.
    
    return path



How to Test:
Use the example provided or create your own test cases.
Example Usage:

islands = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
]
print(hamiltonian_path(islands))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3] or other valid path





Explanation:
is_valid: Ensures that the vertex can be added to the path.
hamiltonian_path_util: Recursively builds the path, backtracking when necessary.
hamiltonian_path: Initializes the path and starts the search.


This challenge will test your ability to implement recursive algorithms, backtracking, and graph traversal.
